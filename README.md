While Russia is destroying my home and my country, killing my friends and neighbors - any russian company, organization, or citizen, who do nothing about it,
is prohibited from using this package.
For others - please, pray for us, share information about war crimes Russia is conducting in Ukraine, do everything you can
to urge your governments to be on the right side of history.
Ukraine will prevail! Good triumph over evil! Русский военный корабль, иди нах#й!

# Tips
1. to store passwords you need to install sshpass that allows to offer a password via SSH

    to install it with brew use
    ```
    brew install http://git.io/sshpass.rb
    ```
    for other options see: [https://github.com/kevinburke/sshpass](https://github.com/kevinburke/sshpass)

2. To see all available ssh options run ``man ssh_config``

# TODO
 - [ ] handling of ssh options (-c, -E, -f, -T, -t)
 - [ ] key, password generation
 - [ ] replace sshpass with native go implementation
